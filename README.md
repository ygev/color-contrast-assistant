The Accessibility Assistant ensures that your Sketch elements pass AA+ compliance based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. This is a contribution to the Assistants feature launch for Sketch 68. Unlike an accessibility plugin, an assistant automatically detects accessibility infractions and sends out a notification. If you'd like to learn more about Sketch Assistants and how they differ from Sketch plugins, please [read the documentation on Sketch's website.](https://www.sketch.com/docs/assistants/)
